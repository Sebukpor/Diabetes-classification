# Diabetes Detection Web Application

This web application allows users to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters using a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model. The prediction is made directly in the browser by processing user inputs through a simple HTML form.

## Features
- **Gender Selection**: Choose between Male or Female.
- **Age Input**: Enter your age.
- **Hypertension Status**: Indicate whether you have hypertension (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- **Heart Disease Status**: Indicate whether you have heart disease (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- **Smoking History**: Select your smoking history from the provided options.
- **BMI Input**: Enter your Body Mass Index (BMI).
- **HbA1c Level Input**: Enter your HbA1c level (average blood glucose level over the past 3 months).
- **Blood Glucose Level Input**: Enter your current blood glucose level.
- **Predict Button**: After entering all required information, click the "Predict Diabetes" button to receive a prediction.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files and directories:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the form and loading the TensorFlow.js model.
- **model/**: A directory containing the TensorFlow.js model files (`model.json` and weight shards).

## Dependencies
- **TensorFlow.js**: The library is loaded via CDN in the HTML file, allowing the model to run in the browser.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

## Acknowledgements
- **TensorFlow.js**: For enabling machine learning in the browser.
- Any other libraries or resources used in this project.
